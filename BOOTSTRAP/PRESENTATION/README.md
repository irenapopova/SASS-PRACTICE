#### Bootstrap 4 Grid System

The Bootstrap 4 Grid System is used for responsive layouts.

#### NOTE
A responsive layout represents the way elements align in the page on different resolutions. It is important you understand how to use the grid before learning about any other Bootstrap 4 component, because whatever element you use, you will need to place it somewhere on the screen.
