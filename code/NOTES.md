#### SASS /Scss

The browser cannot read SASS, it has to be compiled to CSS.

 using partials I can separate major components into partials
 (this is helpful when working with a team on large projects)

 #### FUNCTIONS
 Fuctions should be used to compute values and return values, 

 @mixins are similar to functions but they define STYLES , 

 an example for @mixin is choosing between light and dark theme

 Boolean values can be assigned to variables.

 ### EXTENTIONS
 Element can be extended.
