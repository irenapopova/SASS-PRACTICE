#### SASS Practice

### SCSS better to use 

#### INDENTED SYNTAX IS SASS and it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semi columns.

##when create a scss folder with a file main.scss, and sass watch is creating automatically the css folder

#### NOTE
#### never modify the CSS file , only modify the SCSS file
