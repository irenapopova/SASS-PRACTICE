#### repo consists my notes and my sass/scss exercises
#### What is sass/ scss?

SASS stands for syntactically awesome stylesheets and does not run in the browser.

Instead it extends CSS during development only. 

#### SASS FEATURES

##### NESTED RULES
##### HELPER FUNCTIONS
##### INHERITANCE
##### MIXINS
##### PARTIALS
##### CONDITIONAL LOOPS
##### VARIABLES


what can be done in general with SASS is to nest CSS rules to shorten the code.
With use of helper functions certain things can be achieved like making a color a bit more brighter,
With mixins I can create reusable snippets of code.
The code can be easily split into multiple files with PARTIALS. 
Variables can be defined if a certain hex code of color gets used a couple of times on the page, instead of writing that hex code every time and changing it whenever change the color , I can simply store it in a variable. 
CONDITIONS  and LOOPS can also be used.

#### installing sass
In order to compile SASS it should be installed. 
SASS is a Ruby gem, a tool build with Ruby and therefore it requires the Ruby runtime to work.
